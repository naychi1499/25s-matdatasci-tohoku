# Guides for Writing your report

For the full document:

* you can use a html output but you need to keep the sectioning
* You are writing a comprehensive report
* The goal is to communicate to others
* Need to focus on communicating
* There should be no code or text not in the appropriate headings below
* Delete/comment out extra notes (like these) or others so your document is as clear as it can be
* Reference your figures, tables, equations in the document.
* Captions are needed on all figures, tables, and equations.
* Think about your audience and clearly communicating.

For the updates:

* please include the previous update for each Submitted Update Document
    + Each update is important to keep for grading
* For the final report remove updates and give a full comprehensive report
* Delete or comment out my notes that you are not using when you submit your documents
    + The extra clutter makes communication difficult


# Update 2

* Please put a bulleted list of things you have accomplished since the last update
  + Include things that didn't work but you tried
  + Things you are planning on doing
  + Questions that you might have on your project.
* Reference the sections and figures you are dicussing here

# Update 1

We have decided to use the dataset QM24, we are able to manage its data and to print in 3D the center of the atoms composing the molecules.

# Abstract

The accurate prediction of molecular properties from structural information is essential for accelerating discovery in chemistry and materials science. While Density Functional Theory (DFT) provides reliable quantum mechanical predictions, its high computational cost limits its applicability in large-scale screening. In this study, we develop a neural network-based regression model to predict molecular properties—specifically total energy—directly from three-dimensional atomic coordinates. Using the DFT_all.npz dataset available from Zenodo, which contains a variety of DFT-computed properties for small organic molecules, we train the model in a supervised manner to learn the structure–property relationship. Our results demonstrate that neural networks can effectively approximate DFT-level accuracy while significantly reducing computation time. This work highlights the potential of machine learning as a scalable alternative to traditional quantum chemical simulations, enabling faster exploration of chemical space for materials and drug design.

# Data Science Methods

We decided to realize a Property prediction of the elements from their 3D molecular structure. We will use Supervising trqining on Neural Network. To do so we will use the 3D properties of the molecules as training inputs, then we will train the network with the use of the desired Property (Atomization Energy for example) as a label.

The input data should need no pretreatment. The output label should be a continous value defining the property of the element.

The dataset is composed of 784875 element wich is a quite huge amount of data (to compare, MNIST which is a basic digit recognition dataset contains 70000 elements) so the split between training subset and test subset should be relevant.

The main limit of this method is for each property we would lik to predict, we would have to entirely redo the training with a different label.
